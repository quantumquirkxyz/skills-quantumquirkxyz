# Testing

Use this skill when the project needs a testing strategy beyond a single feature slice. It should make the seams, levels, and coverage boundaries explicit so tests stay behavior-focused and maintainable.

## Contract

- Input: testing brief, system surface, and test stack.
- Output: a test strategy, seam guidance, and coverage boundaries.
- Scope: design test strategy, not implementation details.
- Rule: test the public seam first, not the internals.
- Rule: distinguish unit, integration, and end-to-end ownership clearly.
- Rule: avoid speculative coverage that does not prove user-visible behavior.

## Steps

1. Identify the public behavior that needs protection.
2. Choose the smallest seam that proves that behavior.
3. Assign the right test level to each behavior slice.
4. State what is intentionally not covered.

## Completion criteria

- the test seam is named
- the test level is named
- the coverage boundary is explicit
