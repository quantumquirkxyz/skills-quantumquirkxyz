# Interactive Tutorial Builder

## Contract

- Input: a Skill name and learner context.
- Output: learning goals, exercise, expected outputs, checkpoint, and response space.
- Boundary: generate instructional scaffolding; the learner remains responsible for executing the Skill.

Run `node .agents/skills/platform/skill-lab.mjs tutorial <skill-name>`. Adapt the generated exercise to the learner's context, keep the target Skill's stop condition intact, and require evidence at the checkpoint.
