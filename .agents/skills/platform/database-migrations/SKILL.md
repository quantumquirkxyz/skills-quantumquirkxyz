# Database Migrations

Use this skill when a schema or data-shape change needs to be made safely. It should sequence the move, identify backwards-compatibility concerns, and keep data integrity visible.

## Contract

- Input: schema change request, data shape, and migration context.
- Output: a migration plan, rollback guidance, and data integrity checks.
- Scope: plan the migration, not the live execution.
- Rule: prefer expand-then-contract when callers need time to move.
- Rule: call out destructive steps and their rollback path explicitly.
- Rule: keep compatibility windows short but real when the change spans deploys.

## Steps

1. Identify the current and target schema shapes.
2. Choose the safest migration ordering.
3. Define rollback and data integrity checks.
4. Note when the migration must be coordinated with application code.

## Completion criteria

- the migration order is named
- the rollback path is named
- the data integrity checks are concrete
